Figure 1. Rhythm defined in two parts. First part articulates prolated running
notes of written duration 1. Second part articulates prolated running notes of
written duration 2. Written duration 2 expressed as an integer power of 2
multiple of written duration 1. User input specifies nonnegative integer number
of notes in stage 2; any remaining notes interpreted as belonging to stage 1.
Stage 1 prolation specified as integer number of extra counts of written
duration 1. Stage 2 prolated also specifier as integer number of extra counts
of written duration 1. There's also a ReadingSpecifier passed as input to the
class at configuration time: cyclically determines how the music-maker reads
input pitches. Aribtrarily many articulation specifiers per figure. Each
articulation specifier can select notes from the first part, second part or
both parts. One hairpin specifier per figure. Each hairpin specifier can select
notes from the first part, second part or both parts. Arbitrarily many
transition specifiers per figure with each able to select notes from the first
part, second part or both parts.

Figure 2. Fixed pitch reiterated in a single voice (possibly as an open string)
against other pitches changing around the fixed pitch in close intervals.

Figure 3. Basic two-voice figure. Denominator set at configuration time
(defaults to 16). Upper talea set at configuration time. Lower talea set at
configuration time. Minimum figure duration set at configuration time (defaults
to none). Upper pick-up set at configuration time (to nonnegative integer or
none). Lower pick-up set at configuration time (to nonnegative integer or
none.) Extra counts per figure set at configuration time (defaults to none and
set to cyclic list of integers). Maximum notes per figure set at configuration
time (defaults to none and set to cyclic list of integers). Upper and lower
articulation specifiers set at configuration time. Upper and lower dynamic
specifiers set a configuration time. Pitch segment passed at calltime. Order of
input pitches preserved. Input pitches clustered by register with only two
registers allowed. Pitches of upper voice articulated as running tuplet.
Pitches of lower voice articulated as running tuplet. Empty calltime input
returns empty list. Single-pitch calltime input returns skip-filled selection
in upper voice together with one-note selection in lower voice. Calltime input
of two or more pitches returns note-filled selection in upper voice together
with note-filled selection in lower voice. Upper pick-up inserts rests at
beginning of upper voice. Lower pick-up inserts rests at beginning of lower
voice. After two-voice clustering of pitch input, base duration used to
articulate each note in voice with greatest number of notes as running tuplet.
Voice with least number of notes articulated as running tuplet time-scaled to
duration of voice with greatest number of notes. Extra counts per figure read
cyclically for every figure and then applied to voice with greatest number of
notes. Minimum figure duration extends duration of last note in each voice, if
necessary. Duration of upper voice selection always equals duration of lower
voice selection. Music-maker produces rests in accordance with negative talea
values.

Call protocol: one string of input pitches always passed on call. If no other
input parameters are passed, then the complete garland of figures is made and
returned as output. Otherwise a figure restriction indicator may be passed as
input on call. When a figure restriction indicator is passed on call, only
select figures are made and returned as output. Each output figure is modeled
as a selection. Output of every music-maker is always a tuple of zero or more
selections.
