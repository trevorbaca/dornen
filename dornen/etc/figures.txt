[1: Measured lead-in] Rhythm defined in two parts. First part articulates
prolated running notes of written duration 1. Second part articulates prolated
running notes of written duration 2. Written duration 2 expressed as an integer
power of 2 multiple of written duration 1. User input specifies nonnegative
integer number of notes in stage 2; any remaining notes interpreted as
belonging to stage 1. Stage 1 prolation specified as integer number of extra
counts of written duration 1. Stage 2 prolation also specified as integer
number of extra counts of written duration 1. ReadingSpecifier set at
configuration time: cyclically determines how the music-maker reads input
pitches.

[2: Reiterative pedal] Fixed pitch reiterated in a single voice (possibly as an
open string) against other pitches changing around the fixed pitch in close
intervals.

[3: Color arpeggiation] Single chord rapidly arpeggiated for a series of
arbitrarily many stages. Each stage may be time-treated with prolation or local
accelerandi. SCP transitions specified over groups of stages. Version ending
with ritardando used to approach a harmonic. Version terminating on sustained
stage of maximum brittleness on the bridge used as timbre transition to
altissimi beyond the fretboard.

[4: Irregular altississimi] All on first string. Piano version. Pianissimo
version. Forte version. Fortissimo version. Dynamics differ strikingly. Can be
animated with exact 24-ET pitches. Not clear whether RH attack should be with
RH fingernail, pick, metal rod, glass rod. Characteristic rhythm in irregular
scaled eighth notes but not sixteenth notes. Version possible with LH simply
pinching first string without recourse to butterknife. Use cross note heads and
ottava spanner. Combines well with open-string pedal rearticulated sparingly.
Combines well with jeux des harmoniques.

[5: One-note rearticulation] Measured RH single-finger pattern or measured RH
flamenco pattern on a single pitch. Hypnotic version with regular rhythm and
gentle dynamics. Extremely fluid version with irregular rhythm and gentle
dynamics. Mechanical version with regular rhythm and insistent dynamics.
Convulsive version with irregular rhythm and irregular dynamics.

[6: One-note color rearticulation] SCP transitions effected against [one-note
rearticulation].

[7: Glissandi altississimi tremolandi] Rapid RH finger tremolo: either Spanish
finger pattern or rapid mandolin fingering. Glissandi between most but not all
note heads. Hairpins especially effective. Transitions into measured one-note
rearticulation.

[8: Glissandi altississimi riarticolati] Like glissandi altississimi tremolandi
but executed with a serrated scraper held between the thumb and forefinger of
the RH. Maybe possible to find an extremely small scraper to play the material
truly pianississimo.

[9: jeux des harmoniques] Canonical on sixth string. Version that attaches capo
tasto to fret 0 and then moves successively to frets I, II, etc to raise the
fundamental. Combines perfectly with irregular altississimi. 

[10: pianissimo quartertone dyads]

[11: snap pizzicati] Input a sequence of zero or more pitch-class segments.
Output a single selection together with a single time signature. (Empty input
returns an empty selection together with the zero-valued time signature 0/1.)
Treat each pitch-class segment according to the following: make rhythm equal to
repeated eighth notes; customize rhythm according to
stage_to_rhythm_maker_succession[0]; set register to middle or low; attach snap
pizzicato to every note; apply forte to nonlast notes and fortissimo to last
note. Beam according to beam specifier. Implement beam_across_void boolean
input parameter.

[12: glissandi scatti] Quick jerky glissando segments. First version plucks
some segment startpoints with RH. Second version uses motion of LH only:
glissandi scatti non articolati.

[13: graced rests] Single acciaccaturas leading to a rest. Contrasted with main
notes played exactly on the beat.

[14: two-note alternation] With accents on every third note; with intermittent
rhythmic variation during figure; with gradually changing hairpins. Bears
intermittent appearances of other figures particularly well. Transforms into
open notes of other figures particularly well.
