[1: measured lead-in] Prolated sixteenth notes followed by differently
articulated prolated eighth notes. Fixed number of eighth notes with remaining
number of pitches per figure allocated to sixteenth notes of first stage.

[2: reiterative pedal] Fixed pitch reiterated on a single open string against
other pitches changing around the fixed pitch in close intervals. Occurs first
time as G3 pedal on open (3) string. Occurs second time as Bqs pedal on open
(2) string. Notates in multiple voices. Reiterative pedal notated in one voice.
Multipitch figuration notated in one or more additional voices.

[3: convulsive multipitch figures]

[4: color arpeggiation] Single chord rapidly arpeggiated for a series of
arbitrarily many stages. Each stage may be time-treated with prolation or local
accelerandi. SCP transitions specified over groups of stages. Version ending
with ritardando used to approach a harmonic. Version terminating on sustained
stage of maximum brittleness on the bridge used as timbre transition to
altissimi beyond the fretboard.

[5: irregular altississimi] All on first string with LH pinching 24-ET pitches
beyond the fretboard. Fingerpads and fingernails differ strikingly. Dynamics
differ strikingly. First version played piano with fingerpads in quick tiptoe
rhythm (written as diminished eighth notes mixed with diminished sixteenth
notes). Second version played forte in quick-but-heavy footfall rhythm (written
as diminished eighth notes). Notates with cross noteheads and ottava spanner.
Piano and forte versions of material interleave especially well as a type of
crossfade between two separate voices that start predominantly piano with 
intermittent forte and develop gradually to predominantly forte with
intermittent piano. Crossfade effects two complete cycles from piano to forte
and back to piano. Transitions especially effectively up the string to deadzone
quivering.

[6: deadzone quivering] Rapid RH mandolin tremoli on strings (1) and (2)
immediately in front of the bridge. LH deadens strings at extremely high
altississimi pitches. Parameterizes with difference between single-string
tremoli and two-string temoli. Parameterizes with transitions between different
strictures of tremolo. Parameterizes with glissandi between LH altississimi
pitches. Activates with sudden LH down-glissandi that cover almost all of the
strings' course with RH tremoli continue.

[7: OB quivering] Rapid RH mandolin tremoli directly on the irregular surface
of the bridge. LH tacet. Particularly effective as an attention-holding
material to allow the LH to take one of the scrapers all the way from a stand
or sidetable to the RH in an expansive arc.

[8: one-note rearticulation] Measured RH single-finger pattern or measured RH
flamenco pattern on a single pitch. Hypnotic version with regular rhythm and
gentle dynamics. Extremely fluid version with irregular rhythm and gentle
dynamics. Mechanical version with regular rhythm and insistent dynamics.
Convulsive version with irregular rhythm and irregular dynamics.

[9: one-note color rearticulation] SCP transitions effected against [one-note
rearticulation]. Hypnotic version with regular rhythm and gentle dynamics.
Extremely fluid version with irregular rhythm and gentle dynamics. Mechanical
version with regular rhythm and insistent dynamics. Convulsive version with
irregular rhythm and irregular dynamics. Convulsive version juxtaposes
especially well with convulsive multipitch figures.

[10: glissandi altississimi tremolandi] Rapid RH finger tremolo: either Spanish
finger pattern or rapid mandolin fingering. Glissandi between most but not all
note heads. Hairpins especially effective. Transitions into measured one-note
rearticulation.

[11: glissandi altississimi riarticolati] Like glissandi altississimi
tremolandi but executed with a serrated scraper held between the thumb and
forefinger of the RH. Maybe possible to find an extremely small scraper to play
the material truly pianississimo.

[12: jeux des harmoniques] Canonical on sixth string. Version that attaches
capo tasto to fret 0 and then moves successively to frets I, II, etc to raise
the fundamental. Intermixes well with irregular altississimi. 

[13: pianissimo quartertone dyads]

[14: snap pizzicati] Piano version. Forte version. Intermixes with most other
materials. 
# HERE
Intermixes with measured lead-in.

Intermixes with convulsive multipitch figures. Intermixes with
whisked glissandi scatti.

[15: deadened half-harmonics] Piano version. Forte version. Similar function to
snap pizzicati. Intermixes with most other materials.

[16: pitched glissandi scatti] Quick jerky glissando segments. RH plucks first
note. Many different rhythmic characters available.

[17: whisked glissandi scatti] Quick jerky glissando segments. RH tacet. Many
different rhythmic characters available.

[18: looped whisked glissandi scatti] Whisked glissandi scatti caught in a
mechanical vortex. Turns Nico momentarily into mechnical puppet.

[19: one-note grace rests] Series of rests each preceded by a single
acciaccatura. Contrasts with main notes played exactly on the beat.

[20: multinote graced rests] Series of rests each preceded by a multinote
acciaccatura. Develops into [multinote grace tuplets].

[21: multinote grace tuplets] Series of relatively moderate tuplets each
precede by a multinote acciaccatura. Especially effective when tuplets are all
the same duration.

[22: two-note alternation] With accents on every third note. With intermittent
rhythmic variation during figure. With gradually changing hairpins. Juxtaposes
intermittent appearances of other figures particularly well. Transforms into
introductory notes of other figures particularly well.
