1. four different scrapers: delicate, medium, large, aggressive.

2. scraper acquisition gesture. dramatically wide LH arc. pantomimed once early
in the piece. pantomimed twice in succession later in the piece. executed with
scraper at start of the close of the piece.

3. striking rests at the end of the piece.

4. curtail figure-final long durations to amplify the effects of
voice-intermittency.

5. "lift" string rather than "pinch" string because LH index finger can be
placed under string.

6. energy accumulates towards transformation boundary; energy persists across
transformation boundary. alternatively, energy accumulates towards
transformation boundary; rhythmic energy persists across transformation
boundary but dynamic plummets at start of transformation. alternatively, energy
decreases towards transition boundary to allow emergence of the reiterative
materials. how can hypnotic repetition mediate strumming (rasgueado) and
scraping (rascado)? rate of rasgueado can be controlled exactly; rate of
rasgueado may be made to retard dramatically to individual nail clicks;
especially effective if the pitch is high and the timbre is brittle. heartbeat
thumb tamburo; two-finger tamburo trill; three-finger tamburo trill;
four-finger tamburo trill.
