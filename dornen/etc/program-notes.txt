The inscription at the head of the score reads:

Dangerous to the hand and pleasing to behold, the thorns arise in whorls.
Pockmarked --- sometimes smooth --- the thorns' emergence record sites of
recurrent violation. Read in blood --- a pinprick, nothing more --- the thorns
transfigure our fairytales; reread in metal, the thorns metastasize according
to a regime of walls and barbed wire. The American West, children read at their
desks, developed in a proliferation of these fences across which cattle can not
pass, inscribing in the movements of animals the decisions of an economics that
totalizes both them and us alike. If only these ribbons --- and with them their
thorns --- had expired in the sun of our rangeland. If only the bodies confined
at these folds were of another place, another type, a never-then. If only the
thorns were not now.
