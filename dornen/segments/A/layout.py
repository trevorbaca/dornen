# NOTE: LilyPond coredumps when line-breaking this page to three systems.
#       Unclear why this happens;
#       Does not appear immediately related to acciaccature.
#       Will probably require reductive testing.
#       Workaround leaves this page laid out on only two systems.
#       LilyPond "already have slur" warnings are not the cause.
